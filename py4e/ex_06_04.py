# There is a string method called count that is similar to the function in the previous exercise.

# str.count(sub[, start[, end]])
# Return the number of non-overlapping occurrences of substring sub in the range [start, end]. Optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation.

word = "banana"
n = word.count('a')
print(n)
