## Systematic Program Design

The basic steps of a function design recipe

1. From problem analysis to data definitions
   > formulate data definitions and illustrate them with examples
2. Signature, Purpose Statement, Header
   > state what kind of data the desired function consumes and produces
3. Functional Examples
   > work through examples that illustrate the function's purpose
4. Function Template
   > translate the data definitions into an outline of the function
5. Function Definition
   > fill in the gaps in the function template
6. Testing
   > articulate the examples as tests and ensure that the function passes all
