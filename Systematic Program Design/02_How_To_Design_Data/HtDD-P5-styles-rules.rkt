; PROBLEM:
; 
; You're redesigning the SeatNum data definition from lecture, and you're not
; sure if you've done it correctly. When you ask a TA for feedback, she tells
; you that you haven't followed our style rules and she asks you to re-format 
; your data definition before she gives you feedback.
; 
; a) Why is it important to follow style rules?
; 
; b) Fix the data definition below so that it follows our style rules. Be sure to 
; consult the style rules page so that you make ALL the required changes, of which 
; there are quite a number.


;; SeatNum is a Natural[1,32]
;;interp. The number of a seat in a row, Seats 1 and 32 are aisle seats.

(define SN1 1)
(define SN2 32)

#;
(define (fn-for-seat-num sn)
  (... sn))

;; Template rules used:
;;  - atomic non-distinct: Natural[1,32]
